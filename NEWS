  o  fixed bugs in mada when xte and yte are missing
  o  in DESCRIPTION, change Imports: gbm to Depends: gbm, the results can be different for mada

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-6 (12-23-2014)
  o  intercept estimated
  o  hingeloss and hingengra were modified, they are for family="hinge" since version 0.3-11. Before version 0.3-6, they are for family="hinge2".
  o  function rbst added: boosting plus difference of convex algorithm with truncated loss functions

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-7 (03-14-2015)
  o  add intercept estimate for family=gaussian and center=FALSE

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-8 (04-06-2015)
  o  add family="expo" in bst function and rfamily="texpo" in rbst function for exponential loss and truncated exponential loss, respectively
  o  terminate boosting and robust boosting if loss value inreases

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-9 (06-19-2015)
  o  add robust multi-class boosting rmbst.R

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-10 (08-13-2015)
  o  change the algorithm with respect to base class in mbst.R
  o  change bst function with twinboost=TRUE for learner="ls". In the previous versions, bst implemented the General Twin L2Boosting with general weak learner (Alg 1), rathter than Twin L2Boosting with componentwise linear least squares (Alg 2), cf: Buhlmann and Hothorn (2010). However, as Proposition 2 demonstrates, Alg 1 is not equal to Alg2 unless underlying regression model is orthonormal. The change is to match Alg 1. 

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-11 (12-07-2015)
  o  add parallel computing for cross-validation in cv.bst function
  o  add twintype argument for learner="ls" and twinboost=TRUE. If twintype=2, it does the same before and excluding version 0.3-10. If twintype=1, it does the same as version 0.3-10 
  o  change argument "type" in bst and related functions to "threshold"
  o  add vignette file
  o  in function bst, boosting was terminated early if the fitted loss function value increased. This was changed and boosting only terminates for those loss functions related to truncated loss functions
  o  add inst/extdata and two vignettes 

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-12 (12-23-2015)
  o  add a data analysis example to khan.Rnw
  o  add a new vignette mcl.Rnw
  o  modify ex1data function
  o  fix a bug in predict.mbst when newdata=NULL and newy=NULL

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-13 (01-07-2016)
  o  recall terminating boosting if loss value inreases in bst function, but still terminating for rbst if loss value increases
  o  check if response is 1/-1 in bst and rbst for (margin based) binary classification problem
  o  modify cv.bst to be computationally efficient using predict function more properly
  o  add cv.rbst and cv.rmbst
  o  change type=c("risk", "misc") to type=c("loss", "error") in cross validation related functions, to be consistent with predict functions
  o  add cv.rbst
  o  add index.html to inst/doc

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-14 (03-12-2016)
  o  add family="closs", "clossMM", "clossR", "clossRMM", "gloss", "glossMM", "qloss", "qlossMM" in bst function
  o  add rfamily="closs", "gloss", "qloss" in rbst function
  o  add family="closs", "clossMM" in mbst function
  o  add rfamily="closs" in rmbst function
  o  add vignette files for breast cancer data analysis

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-15 (07-31-2017)
  o  stop bst running if any fk=NULL and family="tgaussianDC", "thingeDC", "tbinomDC", "binomdDC", "texpoDC", "tpoissonDC", "thuberDC", "clossR", "clossRMM", "clossMM", "glossMM", "qlossMM"))
  o  importFrom("doParallel", "stopImplicitCluster")
  o  add stopImplicitCluster() after registerDoParallel
  o  change the offset value for family="huber", "thuber" or "lar". This is the initial value of boosting in bst function
  o  add a new parameter 'start' in bst_control, a logical value. If start=TRUE and fk in bst_control is a vector of values, then bst iterations begin with fk. Otherwise, bst iterations begin with the default values. This can be useful, for instance, in rbst for the MM boosting algorithm.
  o  drop bst-package.Rd in man directory

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-18 (05-17-2019)
  o  stop bst running if any fk=NULL and family="tgaussianDC", "thingeDC", "tbinomDC", "binomdDC", "texpoDC", "tpoissonDC", "thuberDC", "clossRMM", "clossMM", "glossMM", "qlossMM"))

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-19 (07-24-2019)
